# Render Progress 3D Visualization - Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
A minimal, elegant 3D visualization tool for monitoring render progress, accessible both locally and remotely.

## Core Features
- [x] Basic server setup with Express and WebSocket
- [x] File system monitoring for render output
- [x] 3D cube grid visualization
- [x] Real-time progress updates
- [x] Basic progress statistics (%, ETA, time elapsed)

## Current Implementation Status
- [x] Server-side file watching
- [x] WebSocket communication
- [x] Basic 3D visualization
- [x] Local network access
- [ ] Remote deployment configuration
- [ ] Enhanced visualization features
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## Planned Enhancements

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- [ ] Add frame sequence detection
- [ ] Implement frame number extraction from filenames
- [ ] Add render settings configuration
- [ ] Improve progress calculation accuracy

### Phase 2: Visualization Improvements
- [ ] Add color gradients for progress
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions
- [ ] Add frame preview on hover
- [ ] Improve lighting and materials
- [ ] Add grid size configuration

### Phase 3: User Experience
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Implement camera presets
- [ ] Add progress history graph
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Add dark/light theme toggle

### Phase 4: Remote Deployment
- [ ] Glitch.com deployment setup
- [ ] Environment variable configuration
- [ ] Security considerations
- [ ] Cross-origin resource sharing
- [ ] Connection status indicators

## Technical Requirements
- Node.js environment
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Local network access for local deployment
- Glitch.com account for remote deployment

## Development Guidelines
1. Keep dependencies minimal
2. Maintain clean, documented code
3. Focus on performance
4. Ensure cross-browser compatibility
5. Follow responsive design principles

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Local file system monitoring
- [ ] WebSocket connection stability
- [ ] 3D visualization performance
- [ ] Mobile device compatibility
- [ ] Network latency handling
- [ ] Error recovery
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

## Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Local network configuration
